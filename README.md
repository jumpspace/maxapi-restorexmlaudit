This is a project created from a client call to restore deleted Maximizer records. A recent backup did not exist as a source of the restore, so the data in Maximizer's own Audit Log was used. This project is a culmination of attempting to reconstruct Maximizer records from XML data stored in the Audit Log table.
The files here are considerd "draft" or "raw", because it's not an out-of-the-box solution for those looking to use their own databases' Audit Log to restore data. As I refine the process, I will update the files here as needed.
Feel free to download and view the contents. 
I am a Node.JS novice, so there will be coding constructs in these files that may be "nonsense" to you but it worked in reconstructiong Maximizer records.
